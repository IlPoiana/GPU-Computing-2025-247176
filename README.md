# Enhancing Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMv) through GPUs

## Overview
This is the repository of the 2025 GPU Computing project course held by University of Trento. The aim of the project is to develop analize and report different parallel programming tecnhiques and algorithmes for **SpMv**, exploiting standard and modern GPU capabilities and architectures, to assess strengths and weaknesses of each analized method.
